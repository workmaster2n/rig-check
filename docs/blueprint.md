# **App Name**: RigSurvey

## Core Features:

- Rigging Project Management: Create and manage multiple rigging survey projects, associating each with a specific vessel or job.
- Detailed Component Input Forms: Interactive forms to input precise specifications for various rigging components including shrouds, stays, runners, halyards, seagull strikers, and inner forestays. Fields will cover quantity, length, diameter, material, termination types (upper/lower), and pin sizes.
- Component Management: Functionality to add, edit, and remove individual rigging components and their details within an active survey.
- Survey Data Storage & Retrieval: Securely save all entered rig survey data and allow users to retrieve, view, and update previous surveys at any time.
- AI Hardware List Generator Tool: Utilize an AI tool to automatically compile a comprehensive list of all required hardware, including quantities and suggested replacement parts, based on the detailed component data entered by the user.
- Miscellaneous Hardware Section: A flexible section to add and detail any additional or custom rigging hardware not explicitly covered by the structured forms.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, professional blue (#2E80A6) evocative of nautical charts and modern marine equipment. It is versatile enough to serve as an accent or highlight against a dark background.
- Background color: A muted, desaturated dark slate blue (#262E33), providing a clean, contemporary canvas that reduces eye strain in varied lighting conditions.
- Accent color: A vibrant aqua green (#1AE5DA) used sparingly for critical call-to-action buttons, active states, and to draw attention to important information, offering a sharp contrast to the primary and background hues.
- Headline and body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) chosen for its clean, modern, and objective appearance, ensuring excellent readability of technical specifications and detailed forms.
- Line icons: Utilize a consistent set of minimalist line icons that represent nautical hardware, measurement tools, and general UI actions, maintaining a clean and professional aesthetic.
- Form-centric design: Implement a clear, sectioned layout for data input, prioritizing spaciousness, visual hierarchy, and logical grouping of related fields to enhance usability during data entry.
- Subtle UI feedback: Employ delicate animations for interactive elements such as saving data, adding new components, or form submission, providing clear and unobtrusive user feedback.
